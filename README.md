# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

## Description

Tasks on .

What I learned from the tasks:

* What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
* How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
* What is a stable sorting algorithm

---

## General Requirements
* Allowed editors: vi, vim and emacs.
* All files were created and compiled on Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS using using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89```
* Code checked with betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

# Tasks

These are all the tasks of this project, the ones that are completed link to the corresponding files.

### [0. Bubble sort](./0-bubble_sort.c)
* Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm
	- Prototype: void bubble_sort(int *array, size_t size);
	- Youâ€™re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements (See example below)

* Write in the file 0-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Bubble sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

	- in the best case
	- in the average case
	- in the worst case
